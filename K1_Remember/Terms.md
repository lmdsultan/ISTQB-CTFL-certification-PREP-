###  Coverage
The degree to which specified coverage items have been determined or have been exercised by a test suite expressed as a percentage.

###  Debugging
The process of finding, analyzing and removing the causes of failures in software.  
The process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors

###  Defect
An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or specifications.<br/>
Any variance between actual and expected result .

###  Error
A human action that produces an incorrect result.
A mistake in code is called Error

###  Failure
An event in which a component or system does not perform a required function within specified limits.
A build does not meet the requirements customer side 

###  Quality
The degree to which a component, system or process meets specified requirements and/or user/customer needs and expectations.

###  Quality Assurance
Part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled.
Ensures that end-users get a functional user interface and the best user experience when using a web app or website.

###  Root Cause
A source of a defect such that if it is removed, the occurrence of the defect type is decreased or removed.
A mechanism of analyzing the Defects, to identify its cause, to identify whether the defect was due to “testing, development, requirement or designs miss”.

###  Testing
The process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of software products and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements, to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects.
A process, to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the defects to ensure that the product is defect free in order to produce the quality product.

###  Test Analysis
The activity that identifies test conditions by analyzing the test basis.
It is the process of analyzing the test basis and defining test objectives. It covers WHAT is to be tested.

###  Test Basis
The body of knowledge used as the basis for test analysis and design.
Defined as the source of information or the document that is needed to write test cases and also for test analysis.

###  Test Case
A set of preconditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected results and postconditions, developed based on test conditions.
A set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application satisfies requirements or works correctly.

###  Test Completion
The activity that makes test assets available for later use, leaves test environments in a satisfactory condition and communicates the results of testing to relevant stakeholders.
last stage of the software testing life cycle.

###  Test Condition 
An aspect of the test basis that is relevant in order to achieve specific test objectives.

###  Test Control 
A task that deals with developing and applying a set of corrective actions to get a test project on track when monitoring shows a deviation from what was planned.
Guiding and corrective actions to try to achieve the best possible outcome for the project.

###  Test Data
Data created or selected to satisfy the execution preconditions and inputs to execute one or more test cases.

###  Test Design
The activity of deriving and specifying test cases from test conditions.
The act of creating and writing test suites for testing a software.

###  Test Implementation
The activity that prepares the testware needed for test execution based on test analysis and design.
The practice of organizing and prioritizing tests

###  Test Execution
The process of running a test on the component or system under test, producing actual result(s).
The process of executing the code and comparing the expected and actual results.

### Test Execution Schedule
A schedule for the execution of test suites within a test cycle.

###  Test Monitoring
A test management activity that involves checking the status of testing activities, identifying any variances from the planned or expected status, and reporting status to stakeholders.

### Test Object
The component or system to be tested.

### Test Objective
A reason or purpose for designing and executing a test.
The overall goal and achievement of the test execution.

### Test Oracle
A source to determine expected results to compare with the actual result of the software under test. 
A test oracle is a source of information about whether the output of a program (or function or method) is correct or not.

###  Test Planning
The activity of establishing or updating a test plan.

###  Test Procedure
A sequence of test cases in execution order, and any associated actions that may be required to set up the initial preconditions and any wrap up activities post execution.

###  Test Process
The set of interrelated activities comprising of test planning, test monitoring and control, test analysis, test design, test implementation, test execution, and test completion.

###  Test Suite
A set of test cases or test procedures to be executed in a specific test cycle.
A test suite is a collection of test cases related to the same test work.

###  Testware
Work products produced during the test process for use in planning, designing, executing, evaluating and reporting on testing.
A term used to describe all of the materials used to perform a test. Testware includes test plans, test cases, test scripts, and any other items needed to design and perform a test.
It includes all the materials needed for software testing. It is a combination of all utilities and application software.

###  Traceability
The degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more work products.
The ability to trace tests forward and backward through the development lifecycle.

###  Verification
Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled.
Making sure that the product is designed to deliver all functionality to the customer.
Are we building product right ?

###  Validation
Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.
Determining if the system complies with the requirements and performs functions for which it is intended and meets the organization’s goals and user needs.
Are we building right product ?
